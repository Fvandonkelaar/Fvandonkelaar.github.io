While I am passionate about researching galaxy formation and evolution, it's not my only interest. Public outreach has always energized me, and in the future, I hope to combine these two passions to inspire enthusiasm for both astronomy and science as a whole. Currently, however, I channel my outreach skills into another passion of mine: rugby. For the past year and a half, Iâ€™ve served as the public relations manager and graphic designer for my team. During this time, I successfully doubled our followers and boosted engagement by 40% on our posts.
