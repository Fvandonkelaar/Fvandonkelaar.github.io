I'm a Dutch astrophysicist living in Zürich and working as a PhD student at the University of Zürich together with prof. dr. Lucio Mayer. I work on galaxy formation evolution, stellar feedback, and star clusters, but I especially love the thin disc of the Milky Way and the secrets it still has for us. Currently, I'm researching the possibility of the nuclear star cluster being formed from stars in the thin disc & the formation of globular cluster at redshift 4.4 with the GigaEris cosmological, N-body hydrodynamical “zoom-in” simulation. 

I moved to Switzerland after finishing my master's in astrophysics at Lund University in Sweden and my bachelor's in sociotechnical engineering (minor in modern physics) at the University of Twente in the Netherlands. 

I spend my spare time as chair and PR representative of the [University College Twente Alumni Association](https://www.uct-alumni.nl/) (UCTAA) or playing rugby as a  lock, fullback or winger.
