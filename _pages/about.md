Hej, everyone! I'm Floor van Donkelaar, a computational astrophysicist currently residing in Zürich. I'm pursuing my PhD at the University of Zürich in the group of prof. dr. Lucio Mayer, where I'm deeply intrigued by the fascinating world of galaxy formation and evolution, with a particular focus on late-type galaxies like our own Milky Way. In my research, I strive to gain a clearer understanding of these processes by delving into various aspects of galactic structures. This includes investigating phenomena such as stellar clusters, intermediate mass black holes, stellar migration, disc formation, gas accretion, and much more. My ultimate goal is to unravel some of the secrets hidden within the vast realms of galaxies. Currently, I'm researching the fate of thin discs born at a redshift above 4 within cosmological simulations and putting the SFR of the Milky Way into context with the GigaEris cosmological, N-body hydrodynamical “zoom-in” simulation.

My academic journey led me to Switzerland following the completion of my master's degree in astrophysics at Lund University in Sweden and my bachelor’s in sociotechnical engineering (minor in modern physics) at the University of Twente in the Netherlands. 

During my spare time, I love working with public relations and social media. I'm genuinely intrigued by how these algorithms function. I've taken on a variety of roles, including some voluntary positions, in this area. Right now, I'm responsible for managing the public relations of the women's rugby team at Grasshopper Club Zürich Rugby, and I'm also an active player on the team.
