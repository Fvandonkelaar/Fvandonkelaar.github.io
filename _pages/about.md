I'm a Dutch astrophysicist living in Zürich and working as a PhD student at the University of Zürich together with prof. dr. Lucio Mayer. I work on galaxy formation and  evolution, stellar feedback, and star clusters, but I especially love the thin disc of the Milky Way and the secrets it still has for us. Currently, I'm researching the possibility of detecting wandering IMBHs within cosmological simulations and putting the SFR of the Milky Way into context.  

I moved to Switzerland after finishing my master's in astrophysics at Lund University in Sweden and my bachelor's in sociotechnical engineering (minor in modern physics) at the University of Twente in the Netherlands. In my spare time I'm playing rugby as a lock, fullback or winger at Grasshopper Club Zürich Rugby.
