Hej, everyone! I'm Floor van Donkelaar, a computational astrophysicist currently residing in Z√ºrich. I'm pursuing my PhD at the University of Z√ºrich in the group of prof. dr. Lucio Mayer, where I'm fascinated by the world of galaxy formation and evolution, with a particular focus on late-type galaxies like our own Milky Way at high redshift.

My research, I hope to gain a clearer understanding of these processes by delving into various aspects of galactic structures. This includes investigating galactic structures such as stellar clumps, intermediate mass black holes, the galactic centre, stellar migration, disc formation, gas accretion, and much more.  Currently, I'm researching the fate of thin discs born at a redshift above 4 with the <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...928..106T/abstract">GigaEris</a> cosmological, N-body hydrodynamical ‚Äúzoom-in‚Äù simulation and the possibility of high-redshift high stellar mass stellar clumps in disc galaxies, using the <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024ApJ...961...76M/abstract">MassiveBlackHR</a> simulation. Additionally, I'm starting to pre-work for developing a subgrid model specifically designed for high-redshift star clusters within massive galaxies and galaxy clusters. We are also currently also putting the final touches on a completely new large-scale cosmological simulation which models a ‚àº100 cMpc volume of the Universe, the *Phoebos* simulation, so keep your eyes out for that one!

> **Main research interests:** the formation and evolution of galactic structures in Milky Way analogues at high redshift and their interactions with stellar clusters through (cosmological) simulations.

My academic journey led me to Switzerland following the completion of my master's degree in astrophysics at Lund University in Sweden and my bachelor‚Äôs in sociotechnical engineering (minor in modern physics) at the University of Twente in the Netherlands. 

During my spare time, I love to work on public relations, specifically related to social media. I'm intrigued by how these algorithms function, and like to try to beat the system üôÉ. I've taken on a variety of roles as discussed at <a href="https://fvandonkelaar.github.io/outreach/">this page</a>, including some voluntary positions, in this area. Right now, I'm responsible for managing the public relations of the women's rugby team at Grasshopper Club Z√ºrich Rugby, and I'm also an active player on the team (with playing Rugby being another big hobby for me).
