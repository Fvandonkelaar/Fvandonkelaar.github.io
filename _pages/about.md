I'm a Dutch astrophysicist living in Zürich and working as a PhD student at the University of Zürich together with prof. dr. Lucio Mayer. My main research area as a computational astrophysicist is galaxy evolution and formation. 

I moved to Switzerland after finishing my master's in astrophysics at Lund University in Sweden and my bachelor's in sociotechnical engineering (minor in modern physics) at the University of Twente in the Netherlands. 

I spend my spare time as chair and PR representative of the University  college Twente Alumni Association (UCTAA) or playing rugby (fullback or winger).
