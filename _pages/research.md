My big goal would be to uncover each missing step in the process of galaxy formation (one can dream, right?). Telescopes reveal their present-day beauty and now with e.g. JWST we also know now how they looked at higher redshift, but the path from these basic "blops" to fully-formed galaxies remains a puzzle. Imagine it as if we're putting together a complex piece of furniture, using an IKEA manual. We've got the list of parts (stars, gas, and dark matter) and we know what the finished product should look like (galaxies). What we're after are the instructions that bridge the gap, those vital steps in between.

I have been working on bridging this gap in understanding galaxy formation by using powerfull simulations like GigaEris and Phoebos. 

**GigaEris** is like a detailed microscope, zooming in on the formation of a Milky Way-sized galaxy halo. The simulation employs a modern implementation of smoothed-particle hydrodynamics, including metal-line cooling and metal and thermal diffusion. This simulation helps us focus on how galaxies assemble in their early stages, going down to redshift z = 4.4. 

Meanwhile, **Phoebos** will act as a broader view, covering a larger uniform volume of the cosmos. It's like a wide-angle lens, examining the cosmic web and structure formation in a significant volume from an earlier redshift of z = 249.  

Combining these simulations help us with gaining insight into the formation of galaxies, illustrating the transition from fundamental elements such as stars and gas to more complex baryonic structures, including the formation of the nuclear star cluster and/or the formation of stellar discs at high redshift galaxies.
