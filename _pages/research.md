In the cosmic narrative,  we're on a mission to uncover the missing steps in the process of galaxy formation. We know that galaxies contain stars, gas, and mysterious dark matter. Telescopes reveal their present-day beauty, but the path from these basic ingredients to fully-formed galaxies remains a cosmic puzzle. Imagine it as if we're putting together a complex piece of furniture, using an IKEA manual. We've got the list of parts (stars, gas, and dark matter) and we know what the finished product should look like (galaxies). What we're after are the instructions that bridge the gap, those vital steps in between.
