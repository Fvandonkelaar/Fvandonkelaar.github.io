In the cosmic narrative,  we're on a mission to uncover the missing steps in the process of galaxy formation. We know that galaxies contain stars, gas, and mysterious dark matter. Telescopes reveal their present-day beauty, but the path from these basic ingredients to fully-formed galaxies remains a cosmic puzzle. Imagine it as if we're putting together a complex piece of furniture, using an IKEA manual. We've got the list of parts (stars, gas, and dark matter) and we know what the finished product should look like (galaxies). What we're after are the instructions that bridge the gap, those vital steps in between.

We bridge the gap in understanding galaxy formation through powerful simulations like GigaEris and Phoebos.

**GigaEris** is like a detailed microscope, zooming in on the formation of a Milky Way-sized galaxy halo. The simulation employs a modern implementation of smoothed-particle hydrodynamics, including metal-line cooling and metal and thermal diffusion. This simulation helps us focus on how galaxies assemble in their early stages, going down to redshift z = 4.4. Meanwhile, **Phoebos** acts as a broader view, covering a larger uniform volume of the cosmos. It's like a wide-angle lens, examining the cosmic web and structure formation in a significant volume from an earlier redshift of z = 249.  These simulations help us with gaining insight into the formation of galaxies, illustrating the transition from fundamental elements such as stars and gas to more complex baryonic structures, including the nuclear star cluster and the formation of discs.

### GigaEris
The GigaEris simulation has already revealed surprising insights into early galaxy development. We have found that the MW progenitor in the simulation shows a unique fast-growing, thin, spinning stellar disc at z ~ 8 challenging our previous ideas of how these discs formed. This discovery, detailed [here](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...928..106T/abstract), forces us to rethink our understanding of early galaxies. Furthermore, looking at proto-globular clusters around z = 5-4, we found most are connected to gas filaments flowing into main galaxies. However, one outlier seems to be a stripped compact dwarf galaxy that lost its dark matter between z = 5.8 and z = 5.2, which we call an "imposter." Read more about these discoveries [here](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023MNRAS.522.1726V/abstract) to understand how early galaxies formed.

Also, with the use of the GigaEris simualtion we investigated th NSC formation in the progenitor of a Milky Way-sized galaxy, as well as its relation to the assembly and evolution of the galactic nuclear region. This formation might also be closely linked to the nuclear ring. Find more details in [this paper](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023arXiv230312828V/abstract).
