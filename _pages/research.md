I’m interested in understanding the evolution of galaxies. I attack these questions by analysing hydrodynamics simulations of cosmological volumes and isolated galaxies and focus on how specific structures of the galaxies evolve overtime. Below I’ll discuss some of these structures a bit more in detail.

## Stellar Clusters
Based on observation and theoretical models, we know that many stars are born in clusters formed from the same interstellar cloud. My work has focussed in particular on the formation of the nuclear star cluster and globular clusters of the Milky Way. Both are extremely dense star clusters that contain millions of stars tightly packed into a few parsecs. Globular clusters are found in basically all galaxies, from low mass dwarfs  to the most massive galaxies, but also nuclear star clusters are very common: around 70% of galaxies contain a NSC in their centre.
