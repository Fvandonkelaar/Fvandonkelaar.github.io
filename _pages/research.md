My big goal would be to uncover each missing step in the process of galaxy formation (one can dream, right?). Telescopes have already revealed their present-day beauty and now with e.g. JWST we now also get a look on how they looked at higher redshift, but the path from these basic "blops" to fully-formed galaxies remains a puzzle. Imagine it as if we're putting together a complex piece of furniture, using an IKEA manual. We've got the list of parts (stars, gas, and dark matter) and we know what the finished product should look like (galaxies). What we're after are the instructions that bridge the gap, those vital steps in between. I have been working on bridging this gap in understanding galaxy formation by using powerfull simulations, I mainly focus on the formation and evolution of galactic structures in Milky Way analogues. 

## The Simulations
To understand how high-redshift galactic structures evolve into the galactic features we see today, I have been using high-resolution zoom-in simulations such as GigaEris and Phoebo.  These advanced N-body and hydrodynamical simulations will allow us to investigate how early cosmic structures develop into key components like gaseous discs and stellar bulges. **GigaEris** is like a detailed microscope, zooming in on the formation of a Milky Way-sized galaxy halo. The simulation employs a modern implementation of smoothed-particle hydrodynamics, including metal-line cooling and metal and thermal diffusion. This simulation helps us focus on how galaxies assemble in their early stages, going down to redshift z = 4.4.

These high-resolution zoom-in simulations will need to be complemented by large-scale simulations to capture the broader environment, especially the influence of massive galaxy clusters and their interactions at these high redshifts, one such simulation that can be used is the **Phoebos**. This simulation will act as a broader view, covering a larger uniform volume of the cosmos. It's like a wide-angle lens, examining the cosmic web and structure formation in a significant volume from an earlier redshift of z = 249.  

Combining these simulations help us with gaining insight into the formation of galaxies, illustrating the transition from fundamental elements such as stars and gas to more complex baryonic structures, including the formation of the nuclear star cluster and/or the formation of stellar discs at high redshift galaxies.

## The Evolution of the Galactic Structures 
During my PhD, I have tried to shed light on the unique structures and dynamics that should distinguish high-redshift galaxies from their modern counterparts. By  analyzing the properties of various stellar clusters, including Globular and Nuclear Star Clusters, as well as the galactic disc, we have found that key features such as disc formation and stellar clustering were already present in early galaxies, mirroring those in local galaxies today. In a recent study (van Donkelaar et al., 2024b), we identified a critical link between the (pseudo-)bulge and the kinematically cold disc, proposing a groundbreaking "two-phase" disc formation process, in which the early disc evolves into the pseudo-bulge at high redshifts. Earlier work revealed that stars from this kinematically thin disc eventually contribute to the formation of the Nuclear Star Cluster (van Donkelaar et al., 2024a), offering a new hybrid model for cluster formation. While this does not capture the full complexity of high-redshift galaxies, reframing our understanding of these early systems will provide deeper insights into the processes of galaxy formation and evolution.
