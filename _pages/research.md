I’m interested in understanding the evolution of galaxies. I attack these questions by analysing hydrodynamics simulations of cosmological volumes and isolated galaxies and focus on how specific structures of the galaxies evolve overtime. Below I’ll discuss some of these structures a bit more in detail.

## Stellar Clusters
Based on observation and theoretical models, we know that many stars are born in clusters formed from the same interstellar cloud. My work has focussed in particular on the formation of the nuclear star cluster and globular clusters of the Milky Way. Both are extremely dense star clusters that contain millions of stars tightly packed into a few parsecs. Globular clusters are found in basically all galaxies, from low mass dwarfs  to the most massive galaxies, but also nuclear star clusters are very common: around 70% of galaxies contain a NSC in their centre.

### Nuclear Star Clusters
Nuclear star clusters (NSCs) are massive star clusters found in the innermost region of the majority of galaxies. While recent studies suggest that low-mass NSCs in dwarf galaxies form largely out of the merger of globular clusters and NSCs in massive galaxies have assembled most of their mass through central star formation, the formation channel of the Milky Way's NSC is still uncertain.

### Globular Clusters
Although globular clusters (GCs) are very well studied in our local Galactic neighbourhood, their formation and evolution at redshift 𝑧 > 4 remains an unsolved problem. GCs are spheroidal, gravitationally bound collections of stars that are in general very old (∼13 Gyr; e.g. Trenti et al. 2015) structures with stellar masses ∼ <var>10<sup>5</sup></var> – <var>10<sup>6</sup></var> solar masses and are observed to be metal poor (−2.5 > [Fe/H] > 0.3; see e.g. Harris 1991; Elmegreen & Efremov 1997; Fall & Zhang 2001; Brodie & Strader 2006; McLaughlin & Fall 2008; Elmegreen 2010). Furthermore, GCs are found in almost all galaxies with stellar mass 𝑀★ >  <var>10<sup>9</sup></var> solar masses in the local Universe. As they are amongst the oldest astrophysical objects in the Universe, GCs have witnessed most of the formation and evolution processes of galaxies, and can be used to probe them (Brodie & Strader 2006).

In my <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023MNRAS.tmp..909V/abstract">work</a>, we used the cosmological, N-body hydrodynamical 'zoom-in' simulation GigaEris to study the properties and formation environment of proto-GC candidates in the region surrounding the progenitor of a Milky Way-sized galaxy. One of the conclusion we found was that the proto-GC predecessor gas clouds formed in accreting gas filaments in the Circumgalactic region. The stars formed where the gas density exceeded ∼ <var>10<sup>8</sup></var> M⊙ <var>kpc<sup>-2</sup></var>, as shown by the figure below.
